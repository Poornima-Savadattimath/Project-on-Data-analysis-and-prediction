# Project-on-Data-analysis-and-prediction
The project is divided into three levels, each focusing on deeper insights into restaurant data:

Level 1: Data Exploration & Visualization
Load and clean the dataset by handling missing values.
Analyze the target variable ("Aggregate rating") and explore basic statistics.
Study correlations, outliers, and distributions of numerical and categorical features.
Identify top cuisines and cities with the most restaurants.
Visualize geographic distribution and explore relationships between location, ratings, and services.

Level 2: Feature Analysis
Analyze table booking and online delivery availability and their effect on ratings.
Study the distribution and impact of price ranges on customer satisfaction.
Create new features (e.g., name length) and prepare data for modeling.

Level 3: Predictive Modeling & Insights
Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict restaurant ratings.
Explore customer preferences across features like cuisine, price, and location.
Use visualizations to uncover patterns and support data-driven decisions.
